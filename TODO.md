### TODO's:

- Parse `.nd` files to extract relevant metadata & use them for consistent site naming.
- Make the whole thing memory efficient (i. e. don't load the full timeline into memory at the same time).
- Add `parameters.yaml` schema & parsing for metadata that can't be extracted from the microscope (i. e. xy-spacing, fluorescent proteins used, etc...)
